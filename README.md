## Overview

Welcome to our collaborative lab for building foundational systems projects from the ground up. We explore three pillars of systems programming:

* **x86 Assembly Programming** — from MMX/SSE/AVX to mixed C/ASM and IEEE‑754.
* **Linux Kernel & Filesystems** — VFS, custom disk FS, LKMs, mkfs/fsdb, mount/umount.
* **C Compiler** — lexical analysis, parsing, codegen, stack frames, and calling conventions.

Each contributor works independently in their folder, with shared docs and utilities in `/docs`.
